**TASK1**:This project is about designing a simple system that allows users to control an LED light wirelessly using a microcontroller and a mobile app. I used an Arduino Uno as the central microcontroller and an HC-05 Bluetooth module to establish communication between the Arduino and an Android smartphone. The purpose of this project was to demonstrate the basics of home automation using Bluetooth technology. The LED is connected to a digital output pin on the Arduino, and it is controlled through signals sent from the smartphone via the Bluetooth module. To build the mobile app, I used MIT App Inventor, which provided an easy drag-and-drop interface to design a simple GUI with ON and OFF buttons. When the user taps a button, the app sends a specific character (e.g., '1' to turn ON, '0' to turn OFF) via Bluetooth. These characters are received by the HC-05 and passed on to the Arduino.
The Arduino sketch includes code to interpret the received signal and switch the LED accordingly. If the character '1' is received, the LED is turned ON; if '0' is received, it turns OFF. The system is reliable and fast, requiring no internet connection. Everything operates using Bluetooth, which makes it ideal for short-range, low-power control applications. I learned how to establish a serial communication link between the Arduino and an external app, manage code logic for input-based outputs, and design user-friendly interfaces. I also worked with the wiring setup, connecting the HC-05 module to the TX and RX pins of the Arduino through voltage level shifting (since HC-05 works on 3.3V logic).
This project can be seen as the starting point for building more complex smart home systems. The same logic can be extended to control multiple appliances using relay modules. Additionally, the system could be upgraded by replacing Bluetooth with a Wi-Fi-based IoT platform like Blynk or MQTT to allow remote control from anywhere in the world. This task gave me confidence in integrating hardware and software and helped me understand how physical devices and mobile apps can work together for automation. It’s a hands-on example of how IoT begins—with a simple light, a few wires, and a big idea.

**TASK2**:This project is about building a smart home automation system that lets you control multiple devices like lights and fans using your phone. The goal was to create a simple prototype using an IoT platform—either Blynk or MQTT. I chose to use the Blynk platform for its easy interface and real-time communication with hardware. The project allows the user to switch devices ON or OFF remotely from a mobile app, bringing real-world automation into action. The core of the system is an Arduino or NodeMCU board that receives commands from the app and controls the connected devices.
The app is built using the Blynk platform, which provides virtual buttons that link directly to the hardware through the internet. The microcontroller connects to Wi-Fi and communicates with Blynk’s cloud servers. When the user presses a button on the app, a command is sent over the internet to the microcontroller. This command is then used to turn on or off connected relays that control lights and fans. The system is flexible and can be extended to include more appliances.
For the hardware, I used a NodeMCU board, which has built-in Wi-Fi, along with a 2-channel relay module. Each relay is connected to a different appliance—one for a light, the other for a fan. I connected the relays to digital output pins on the NodeMCU. The Blynk app was configured with two virtual buttons: one for each device. The communication was smooth, and the response time between pressing a button and the device responding was nearly instant.
This kind of system is an example of real-world IoT in practice. It shows how we can control and monitor home appliances remotely, which is very useful for convenience and energy savings. The same idea can be scaled up with more relays, sensor inputs, or even automation based on conditions like temperature or time of day. I also explored using MQTT, which is a lightweight messaging protocol, for alternative communication setups. MQTT gives more control over data handling and custom app development.
Overall, this project gave me hands-on experience in building a smart automation system from scratch. I learned about cloud-based communication, device control using relays, and working with IoT platforms like Blynk and MQTT. It helped me understand how smart homes work and how devices can be controlled easily using smartphones and the internet. It’s a great starting point for building bigger, smarter IoT systems in the future.

**TASK3**:This project is about creating a simple security system that can detect motion, capture images, and send alerts to a smartphone. The core of the system is built using an ESP32-CAM module, which has a built-in camera and microcontroller. A PIR (Passive Infrared) sensor is used to detect movement. When motion is detected, the ESP32-CAM activates the camera to capture a photo. This image can be stored locally on an SD card or sent to cloud storage using platforms like Firebase. For real-time alerts, the system is connected to a mobile app using Blynk. Once motion is detected, a notification is sent instantly to the user’s smartphone through the app. The Blynk interface makes the system easy to monitor from anywhere, as long as there is an internet connection. The ESP32-CAM connects to Wi-Fi, enabling image transfer and app notifications. In some variations, MQTT can be used for lightweight messaging and better customizability. The system is compact, power-efficient, and ideal for monitoring entrances, balconies, or any space that requires security. This project gave me practical experience in combining sensors, cameras, and cloud communication for IoT-based surveillance. It also helped me understand real-world applications like smart security systems that can be expanded with face recognition, automatic sirens, or even SMS alerts in future upgrades.

**TASK4**:This project is about designing an IoT-based air quality monitoring device that can measure pollutants in the environment—like PM2.5, CO₂, and harmful gases—and display the data live on a cloud dashboard. I used a microcontroller with Wi-Fi capability, such as NodeMCU or ESP32, to collect sensor data and push it to the internet. The key sensors used include the MQ-135, which can detect gases like ammonia, CO₂, and benzene, and optionally the SDS011 for fine particulate matter (PM2.5). These values give a good estimate of air cleanliness and are especially useful for indoor air safety.
The microcontroller gathers data from these sensors at regular intervals. It processes the readings and sends them to a cloud platform such as ThingSpeak, Blynk, or Google Sheets via Wi-Fi. These platforms are used to visualize the data in real time. With graphs and charts, users can observe how air quality changes over time or in different locations. I used ThingSpeak for this prototype because it's easy to set up and supports live data plotting with time stamps. The dashboard can be accessed from anywhere, using any device with an internet connection.
The system runs continuously and automatically updates the readings without manual intervention. I also included an OLED display in some setups so users can view readings on the spot, without needing internet. In the future, the project can be enhanced to include threshold-based notifications—so when pollution levels rise above a safe limit, the device sends alerts through email, Blynk notifications, or SMS. This makes the system proactive, not just informative.
This prototype has real-world applications in homes, schools, offices, and even vehicles. With rising concerns about air pollution, such systems help users make better choices for their health—like opening windows or turning on air purifiers when needed. It also serves as a great learning platform to understand how sensors work, how data flows in IoT, and how cloud services integrate with embedded systems.
Overall, I gained experience in sensor interfacing, analog-to-digital conversion, Wi-Fi communication, and cloud-based data visualization. The project highlights how IoT can improve quality of life by providing real-time environmental insights. It’s a meaningful step toward smart environmental monitoring and can inspire larger, city-wide applications in the future.
